         Hello & Welcome,  <br/>
         <br/>

         Over the past few years, I have been more and more enthusiastic about Technology. I started my journey by obtaining the fundamental knowledge of computer science from The City University of New York. Upon graduation in the field of Health Informatics I completed self-paced certifications such as Improving your Business through the culture of Health, Data Science with Python, Statistics using R, and Project Management. Because of my passion and continues hunger, I enrolled into Prescholas bootcamp where I have been trained as a Software Engineer and acquired an in-depth understanding of software development, MERN stack, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  <br/>
           <br/>

         As far as work experience, I have worked as a Head Ophthalmic tech and Senior financial sales representative in New York City. I have been involved in an exhaustive program to analyze the business requirements, implement applications, and coach my team for new technologies as well as software updates for more efficient business practices and better client experience. To this end we engaged in lengthy time studies of each project, and we were very successful in increasing efficiency and quality of the work.  <br/>
           <br/>
         I believe that I can bring this expertise to any company and through implementation of my logical, analytical, as well as technical skills increase client satisfaction by a significant amount.
             </ul>
